/**
 * This class is part of the "Task Manager" application.
 * "Task Manager" is a simple, console-based to-do list application.
 *
 * This class holds information about a command that was issued by the user.
 * A command currently consists of two parts: a CommandWord and a string
 * (for example, if the command was "sort list", then the two parts
 * are SORT and "list").
 *
 * The way this is used is: Commands are already checked for being valid
 * command words. If the user entered an invalid command (a word that is not
 * known) then the CommandWord is UNKNOWN.
 *
 * If the command had only one word, then the second word is <null>.
